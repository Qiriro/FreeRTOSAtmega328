      FreeRTOS is a popular[1] real-time operating system kernel for embedded devices, 
			that has been ported to 35 microcontrollers. It is distributed under the GPL with an optional exception.
		    The exception permits users' proprietary code to remain closed source while maintaining the kernel itself 
			as open source, thereby facilitating the use of FreeRTOS in proprietary applications.

			This repository is a port of the FreeRTOS to the popular ATmega329P microcontroller that is used in Arduino Uno.
